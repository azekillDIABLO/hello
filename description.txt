Hello is an ingame image viewer that allows you to see a gallery of images, just by typing /hello. Easy as hello.

#HOW TO USE???

Go in "textures" folder.

Here put file called :
"hello_background_1" then
"hello_background_2" then
"hello_background_3" etc...

When you finished, count the number of files,
then change, in init.lua, "max_page = <number>"
to something like "max_page = 15".

Then it's ok you can use it by typing /hello
